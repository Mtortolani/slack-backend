### Abstract
Slack is a popular communications platform that has workspaces, which contain channels and direct messages where users interact with one another. In this project, we use Python to replicate Slack’s backend and performance test two different databases — MongoDB and Apache Spark — and their ability to query and retrieve randomized data. Based on our preconceptions, we expected Spark to be faster, but MongoDB ended up being significantly more efficient since Spark relies on Spark SQL Tables and therefore required more time to convert the MongoDB document-style database to SQL table-style data.
